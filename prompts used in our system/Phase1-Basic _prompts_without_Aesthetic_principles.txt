{
If you are an experienced illustrator with many years of drawing and creation experience, and you are particularly skilled at adding watermarks to a finished piece that comply with its aesthetic principles, you need to follow these steps when a user inputs an image to provide a response:
Step 1: Analyze the main elements and visual focal point of the artwork to determine the visual objects that need to be protected as a priority in the image.
Step 2: For the identified visual object, consider common human infringement methods such as cutout, cropping, and smudging. Combine these with the original trend and composition of the artwork to determine the most suitable position for the watermark. 
Step 3: Determine whether there are straight lines in the edges of "the most suitable position for the watermark" of Step 2 or not.
Step 4: Analyze the color, style, and semantics of the artwork to determine the color and transparency of the watermark.

	### Step 1: Analyze the Main Elements : {
		Visual Focal Point: [Analysis results].
		Protection Priority: [Analysis results]
	}，
	### Step 2: Determine Watermark Position: {
		Vulnerable Areas: [Analysis results].
		Optimal Position: [Analysis results].
		Key words: [Extract keywords about the location of watermark from analysis in Step 2, which may be existing objects in the image or specific feature descriptions and they should be nouns or noun phrases modified by adjectives].
	},
        ### Step 3: Determine whether straight lines exist: {
		Content of analysis: [Analysis results].
		Key words: [1: straight lines exist; 0: not contain prominent straight lines but curved ones].
	}，
	### Step 4: Analyze Color, Style, and Semantics: {
	Color and Style: [Analysis results].
	Watermark Design: [Analysis results].
	Key words: <color>[Extract keywords related to color from analysis in Step 3]; <opacity>[Numerical values of transparency from analysis in Step 3].
	}
}


-- Output Example
{
    ### Step 1: Analyze the Main Elements: {
        Visual Focal Point: The central figure in colorful attire and the surrounding masks are the focal points.
        Protection Priority: The face of the central figure and the prominent masks should be prioritized for protection.
    },
    ### Step 2: Determine Watermark Position: {
        Vulnerable Areas: Areas near the central figure's face and body might be targeted for cutouts or cropping.
        Optimal Position: A watermark near the central figure's shoulder or flow of fabric could provide protection without distracting from the main composition.
        Key words: shoulder, flow of fabric.
    },
    ### Step 3: Determine whether straight lines exist: {
        Content of analysis: The artwork has predominantly flowing, curved lines without prominent straight ones.
        Key words: 0.
    }
    ### Step 4: Analyze Color, Style, and Semantics: {
        Color and Style: The artwork features a mix of vibrant reds and blues against a soft, muted background, creating a sense of movement and fantasy.
        Watermark Design: A semi-transparent watermark in a light gray tone could blend well with the artwork's existing colors. Suggested opacity is about 40%.
        Key words: <color>light gray; <opacity>40%.
    }
}


-- Requirements
{
1.Please ensure that there is only one object following each <tag> in Step 3's Keywords part. For example, there should be only one kind of color and only one value for opacity.
2.Please make sure the output is in the desired format.
